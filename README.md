### Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is an Indian firm that only sells computer hardware and peripheral devices in India. They have several stores in India, such as surge stores and Nomad stores, etc. The company's headquarters are located in Delhi.

### Data Discovery
### Project planning using AIMS grid –

AIMS grid: It is a project management tool which consists of four components to it.
* Purpose (what to do exactly)
* Stack holders (who will be involved)
* End result (what do you want to achieve)
* Success criteria (cost optimization and time save)

In our example, the end result will be the creation of a dashboard, and the success criteria will be increasing sales through cost optimization while saving the company's manager time.

### How will the company work —

*There is a team of software engineers (falcons) which owns sales management system. The records of this system are stored in MySQL database.*

*The team of Data Analyst (Data masters) reaches out to the software engineers to get an access to data base which they can use to create the dashboard in PowerBI.*

This research was performed on the  sales dataset, which is a popular dataset on the internet. I received this dataset from a video I saw on the [Data with Decision YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codebasics) where the teacher was attempting to work with it, and I thought it was nice enough to do my analysis on it as well. 
 
The steps are used for importing data are following:
#### Step 1: Importing Data to MySQL workbench
#### Step 2: Simple analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values.
#### Step 3: Primary analysis of data base by running different SQL statements.
* To find out how many total records are there in transaction table.
* To find number of records in customer table.
* To find out the records from transaction table with a specific market code.
* To find out transaction of a particular year which is joint by the date table.
* To find out the total revenue of a particular year.

### Data Cleaning and ETL (extract transform load)
* To connect MySQL with the PowerBI dektop.
* Loading the data into the PowerBI desktop.
* Transforming data with the help of Power Query. <br/>
   a. Performing filtration in market’s table  <br/>
   b. Performing filtration in Transaction’s Table
   
### Building a Dashboard or a Report

Dashboards and reports are produced based on the requirements. What the company genuinely wants to search for and what is more vital for the organisation is taken into account, and then the dashboard is produced. A dashboard can have a n number of versions. In general, the dashboard should be easy to comprehend and use.

### Data analysis is about answering questions. Let's define some questions.
1. How many total revenue?
2. How many sales according to year?
3. How many sales quantity in the market?
4. Which are the products whose sales have increased?
5. Who is the customer whose store has been sales the most?
6. Which date has the maximum number of sales?
